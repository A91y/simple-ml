# Machine Learning Prediction Models

This repository contains machine learning models for predicting car prices, housing prices, and Titanic survival.

## Projects

### Car Price Prediction

The Car Price Prediction model is located in the [CarPricePrediction](CarPricePrediction) directory. It uses the data from `CarPrice.csv` and the trained model is saved as `best_car_price_model.pkl`.

### Housing Price Prediction

The Housing Price Prediction model is located in the [HousingPricePrediction](HousingPricePrediction) directory. It uses the data from `Housing.csv` and the trained model is saved as `best_model.pkl`.

### Titanic Survival Prediction

The Titanic Survival Prediction model is located in the [TitanicSurvivalPrediction](TitanicSurvivalPrediction) directory. It uses the data from `TitanicData.csv` and the trained model is saved as `titanic_model_xgboost.json`.

## Running the Code

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the project you want to run (e.g., `CarPricePrediction`).
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the `model.py` file to train the model: `python model.py`.
5. Run the `prediction.py` file to make predictions: `python prediction.py`.
